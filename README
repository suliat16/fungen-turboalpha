A function generator capable of producing sine, square and trianglular waves of varying frequency.
Created using the Texas Instruments MSP430 microprocessor Rev 1.4 and a sauderless breadboard
Hardware includes two digital to analog converters- a resistor ladder and a low pass filter
Why alpha? There is also a draw mode availble on the function generator, which is controllable using 
2 switches- one for movement in x, and the other for movement in y. However, its super buggy, and the 
microprocessor ran out of memory, resuliting in a snake being drawn on screen. Its also incredibly
and movement in all dimensions is not perfect.
